WellCast is a web-application tool for predicting missing well log data using the machine learning workflow. In this application, we used gradient boost method (tree-based algorithm) which was adapted from the result of [SPE GCS ML Challenge 2021](https://github.com/Geovartha/spe-gcs-ml-challenge-2021-/blob/main/spe_gcs_ml_challenge_2021.ipynb).

WellCast is available as a hosted service at [wellcast.geovartha.id](https://wellcast.geovartha.id/)
